# ComtradeAPI

An attempt to build something that uses the Comtrade API and World Bank data to make something that is a useful too for food and drink trade data. Also to try new (for me) ways of using shiny: displaying images, manipulating datasets, layouts etc.

Should work as is - no proprietary data is used only API calls.
